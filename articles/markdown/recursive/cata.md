# Basic Catamorphisms

Welcome! If you think a catamorphism might be what Professor McGonagall does in
the Harry Potter books then you're in the right place! 

Catamorphisms are a great place to start on your journey towards understanding
recursion schemes as a whole! They aren't as scary as they sound, the prefix
`cata` comes from the Greek word meaning `downwards`, `morph` loosely means 'to
change from one thing to another' so if we squint a bit we can pretend that
`catamorphism` means to reduce something down. Catamorphisms take some _thing_
with an associated 'structure' and reduce it down to some _thing_ with **less**
structure.

If you've been using a functional programming language for a while you're
probably familiar with other ways of reducing structure such as operations from
the `Foldable` typeclass or perhaps using explicit recursion.

Catamorphisms closely resemble the `foldr` function from `Data.List`; let's
compare the two:

```haskell
foldr :: Foldable t  => (a -> b -> b)   -> b -> t a -> b
cata ::  Recursive t => (Base t b -> b)      -> t   -> b
```

If we specialize them both to lists we get the following:

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b)    -> b   -> [a] -> b
cata  :: (ListF a b -> b) ->        [b] -> b
```

There are few things we notice right off the bat: the function we pass to each
of them is slightly different; `foldr` explicitly handles the next element `a`
and the accumulator `b` as arguments as well as passing a **default** `b` to use
in the case that the container is empty. `cata` leaves you to collect and
handle the combination of the accumulated `b`s from your structure yourself,
and to provide your own default behaviour if any of your constructors don't
contain any accumulated value (`Nil` in this case).

The first argument which cata takes (`Recursive t => (Base t b -> b)`) is
called an **F-Algebra**, it's a function which performs a single reduction step
of a recursive operation. See the post on [F-Algebras](/recursive/f-algebras)
to dive in deeper!

Shifting concerns into the algebra actually makes `cata` more powerful than
`foldr`, we have knowledge of the structure of the data we're folding at each
step and can make different decisions based on it, possibly handling recursive
values differently based on their location in the structure (e.g.Â subtract
accumulators in the right branch of a binary tree from those in the left
branch).

Let's write the `sum :: [Int] -> Int` function in a few different ways so we
can compare approaches. We'll do one using `foldr`, one with explicit recursion
and finally one with `cata`. 

Here's the simple `foldr` version:

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=sumFoldr}
```

Here's one with explicit recursion:

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=sumRecursive}
```


Here's the slightly longer `cata` version

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=sumCata}
```

So we can see here that the `cata` version is definitely longer for this
particular case, using `cata` doesn't gain us much when we're operating on
lists since they have no additional structure on top of what `Foldable`
provides us via `toList`; but as we continue onwards to more complex structures
we find that we have more power using an algebra than we do with the `Foldable`
instance of structures.

Let's upgrade our Lists to Trees to see how this plays out!

Here's a data structure representing a [Binary
Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) where each node contains a
value. Notice that we're also deriving a `Foldable` instance for the structure
here using `DeriveFoldable`.

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Data/BinaryTreeF.hs snippet=BinTree}
```

Now we'll write the recursive `Functor` version of the type for use with
recursion schemes where each recursive occurance of the structure is replaced
with a new type variable `r`. 

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Data/BinaryTreeF.hs snippet=BinTreeF}
```

Great! That's a bit more interesting!

To prove that our recursion schemes and algebras give new power over what
Foldable brings we'll attempt to implement some standard tree traversals! If
you're unfamiliar with the concept you can read up more about tree traversals
on the [Wiki
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))!

In short, we want to reduce a tree to a list, but there are several possible
orderings to do it!

It turns out that when we derive the `Foldable` class, the order of the fields
in our constructor actually determines which traversal we get! Since we have
the structure `Branch a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)` GHC will **fold** the 'a' first,
then the left branch followed by the right, corresponding to a depth first
traversal. That means our implementation of Depth-First-Search using foldable
is simply:

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=depthFirstFoldable}
```

Here's the equivalent version using `cata`

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=depthFirstCata}
```

Hopefully that's relatively stright forward! Now for the tricky bit, how do we
define an [*In
Order*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)) traversal
using our Foldable instance? Sorry to break it to ya, but we *can't*! Our
foldable instance only knows how to process all elements, there are no
guarantees on ordering and there's no way for us to talk about the **structure**
of the data as we fold! Using `cata` it's easy! Check it out:

```{.haskell include=articles/src/Examples/Recursive/Cata.hs snippet=inOrderCata}
```

This shows how recursion-schemes and the use of **algebras** helps give
us more **power** by having knowledge of our data's **structure** at the cost of a
little boiler-plate.
